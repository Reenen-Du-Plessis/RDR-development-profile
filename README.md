Name:     Reenen Drikus Roelof
Surname:  du Plessis

With a BSC in Computer Science and over 8 years of experience in iOS development, I am confident in my ability to make a positive contribution to your team.

In my previous role as a Team Lead, I was responsible for managing a team of developers, ensuring that projects were delivered on time and to the highest quality. I also spent two years as a Development Manager, where I led multiple projects and was accountable for the overall success of the development department. In my most recent role as the Head of Training and Development, I designed and delivered training programs to upskill the development team, leading to increased productivity and morale.

My experience and passion for iOS development, combined with my strong leadership skills, make me an ideal candidate for this role. I am eager to bring my expertise and experience to a new challenge and to continue to grow and develop my skills.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications and how I can contribute to your team.

Sincerely,
Reenen du Plessis
